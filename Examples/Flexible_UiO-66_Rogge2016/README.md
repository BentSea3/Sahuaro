# Example: Flexible UiO-66 (Rogge 2016 Force Field)

This example demonstrates a simulation of the flexible metal-organic framework UiO-66 using the force field parameters developed by Rogge et al. using the outputs generated by Sahuaro.

## Force Field Reference

The force field implemented in this example was presented in the following paper. It is recommended to consult the original publication for a complete understanding of the parameters and methodology.

## Directory Contents

* `0_input/`: Contains the Sahuaro input file and the initial CIF structure.
* `1_output/`: Intended for the `in.data` and `in.coeffs` files generated by Sahuaro.
* `2_preparation/`: Contains manual modifications to the outputs produced by Sahuaro.
* `3_simulation/`: Contains the LAMMPS example input script for the production run (`sinput.in`).
* `[analysis_script.sh]`: A helper script for post-simulation analysis.

## Simulation and post-processing

During the NPT simulation, the lattice parameters, angles, and stress tensor elements are calculated and printed to the output files.

## Validation

To validate the implementation, you can compare the obtained results (e.g. lattice parameters, angles, stress tensor elements) with the data provided in the reference paper.

Note: For accurate results and proper validation, run longer simulations to ensure the system has reached full equilibration.
