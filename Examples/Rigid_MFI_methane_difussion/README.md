# Example: Methane Diffusion in Rigid MFI Zeolite

This example demonstrates a simulation of Methane diffusion within a rigid MFI zeolite framework using the outputs generated by Sahuaro. The diffusion coefficient is calculated using two different methods: from the slope of the Mean Squared Displacement (MSD) and via the Velocity Autocorrelation Function (VACF).

## Force Field References

This simulation uses two separate, well-established force fields: one for the all-silica MFI framework and one for Methane. It is recommended to consult the original publications for a complete understanding of the parameters and methodology.

## Simulation and post-processing

Two separate simulations are run to calculate the diffusion coefficient of Methane in the rigid MFI framework:
1.  **Mean Squared Displacement (MSD):** The trajectory of the Methane molecules is tracked, and the slope of the MSD curve is used to determine the diffusion coefficient.
2.  **Velocity Autocorrelation Function (VACF):** The integral of the VACF is calculated to determine the diffusion coefficient.

## Validation

The inputs provided are for example purposes only. To produce data for publication or for a robust validation, you must adapt the inputs accordingly.

Note: For accurate results and proper validation, ensure the system is fully equilibrated and run longer production simulations.
