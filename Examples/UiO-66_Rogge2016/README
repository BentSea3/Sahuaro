Simulation of flexible pristine UiO-66 using the Rogge2016 force field.

Lattice parameters, angles and stress tensor elements are calculated and
printed to file.

Compare obtained results to the ones provided in the paper as validation
of the implementation. Use longer simulations to ensure equilibration.
