# Example: Flexible IRMOF-1 (Dubbeldam 2007 Force Field)

This example demonstrates a simulation of the flexible metal-organic framework IRMOF-1 using the force field parameters developed by Dubbeldam et al.

## Force Field Reference

The force field implemented in this example was presented in the following paper. It is recommended to consult the original publication for a complete understanding of the parameters and methodology.

## Directory Contents

* `0_input/`: Contains the Sahuaro input file and the initial CIF structure.
* `1_output/`: Intended for the `in.data` and `in.coeffs` files generated by Sahuaro.
* `2_preparation/`: Contains LAMMPS input scripts for system preparation (e.g., equilibration).
* `3_simulation/`: Contains the LAMMPS input script for the production run.
* `calculate_bond_averages.sh`: A helper script for post-simulation analysis.

## Analysis

During the simulation, the average lattice parameters are calculated and printed to the standard output.

Additionally, bond lengths are tracked and written to the `bondInfo.dump` file. To calculate and print the average bond lengths from this file, use the included bash script:
```bash
./calculate_bond_averages.sh

## Validation

To validate the implementation, you can compare the obtained results (e.g. average bond lengths) with the data provided in the supporting information of the reference paper.

Note: For accurate results and proper validation, run longer simulations to ensure the system has reached full equilibration.
