Simulation of flexible IRMOF-1 using the Dubbledam2007 force field.

Lattice parameters are calculated, averaged and printed to std output.
Bond lenths calculated and outputted to bondInfo.dump file. Use the
included bash script (calculate_bond_averages.sh) to print average
bond lengths.

Compare obtained results to the ones provided in the paper as validation
of the implementation. Use longer simulations to ensure equilibration.
